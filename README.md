# UX Portfolio

Hi! I'm Emily. Iâ€™m a graphic designer and creative person, and an avid learner and observer. I love the creative process and am a big fan of storytelling and world-building; theme park design is a major passion of mine. I am currently working towards a BFA in Communication Design from California State University, Chico. I plan to graduate in 2023, with hopes to further my education in the fields of visual arts and art direction.

# Staying informed with InfoVote

### Emily McConnell - May 16, 2023 ###
 

InfoVote is a mobile application that provides voters with helpful, educational information about elections. My teammates and I assessed the app during our process of developing a voter education service of our own, so I decided to document some of the more interesting aspects I noticed about their interface design. 

In using InfoVote, my primary goal was to easily find simplified, concise information about officials and political candidates. It is clear that the app was designed for this purpose, but actually using the app this way proved to be a bit more tedious than it looked.

Below is an image of InfoVote's landing page.

After using the app, I feel that InfoVote can be compared to an educational Twitter thread that provides links to information, but not the actual information in the tweets. InfoVote succeeds at guiding users to information, but does not actually provide it themselves. Using the app, I noticed that most times I tapped on an informative button like "Find my senator", I was linked to another site and taken from InfoVote to my Safari app. 

Because of this issue, I kept needing to switch back and forth from InfoVote and Safari, which was incredibly annoying and made me want to close the app entirely. The first time I clicked on one of these buttons, I wasn't expecting to be taken to an external site, and I feel that these link-buttons are **false affordances** and demonstrate lazy design. However, I think that the app could be significantly improved if it provided its own information, and did not rely on linking users to external sites. An example could be pages such as: "Meet X candidate! This is what they do", or "Stuck on the propositions? Our guide breaks them down". In my experience, having original content helps applications feel more authentic, which, in turn, helps them to better succeed at keeping users' attention.

**Update:** *InfoVote has updated their interface to include external sites within the app. This a signficant improvement from what I had previously reported; the app no longer redirects users to Safari or Google Chrome. The image below demonstrates this interaction.*

InfoVote is designed well and has a **minimalist design** that makes it visually appealing. Using a simple color scheme of yellow, black, and white helps the app feel cohesive and gives it a professional look. It demonstrates **status visibility** by utilizing visual cues for each of the five main navigation pages, but it is unclear on what each main page is actually for, as there are no page headers to let users know. For example, I visited the "Polls" page thinking it was a questionnaire page that would suggest information to me based on my quiz results, but after answering each question and seeing a number of votes below, I understood that they were poll questions.

As shown above, attempting to choose a new answer triggers an alert that tells users they have already answered the poll (and cannot change their answer).

From what I experienced, InfoVote isn't exactly **error tolerant**. When answering the poll questions, I accidentally tapped on a wrong answer and could not change it. Additionally, the app lacks **help or documentation** information, as it does not provide any interactive walkthroughs/tours or a FAQ page. It does, however, contain a linked image to a YouTube introductory video upon opening the app. Unfortunately, every time users open the app, they have to click "Skip" to exit the tutorial.

When users tap on the tutorial, they are automatically redirected to YouTube. As with the previous redirecting issue with the "Find My Senator" buttons, this is irritating, and I can imagine it would tests users' patience when they use the app.
